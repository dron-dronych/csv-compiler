# csv-compiler
Simple shell utility to compile csv files with the same structure into one file

## Usage

1. Run the following command to make the file executable:
```console
me@dreamer:~$ chmod 755 compile_files.sh
```

2. After that you can run the program as (assuming you're in the directory with the program):

```console
me@dreamer:~$ ./compile_files.sh DIR
```

OR

simply do the below instead of the above two steps:

```console
me@dreamer:~$ bash compile_fles.sh DIR
```

where DIR is the name of the directory with the files to compile
